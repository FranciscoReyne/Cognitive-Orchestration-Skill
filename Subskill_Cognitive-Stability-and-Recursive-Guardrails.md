# Subskill: Cognitive Stability & Recursive Guardrails (CSRG)



## Definition: 
A safety and optimization layer designed to detect, break, and prevent infinite recursive loops, cognitive resonance, and self-referential saturation.


## Core Mechanisms:

- Recursion Depth Limiting: Sets semantic boundaries on how many "levels deep" an agent can observe its own observation process or that of others.

- Cognitive Damping: Reduces the weight of self-referential feedback to prevent "echo chambers" where the system confirms its own biases through over-analysis.

- Entropy Thresholds: Monitors the complexity of the agent network. If the number of agents or interactions exceeds a predefined "Cognitive Budget," the CSRG triggers a mandatory simplification or stabilization phase.

- Circuit Breakers: An emergency governance act that pauses observation or evolution if the system detects circular reasoning patterns or "hallucination loops."


## Stability Principles:

- Metacognitive Restraint: Agents are instructed that "more observation is not always better."

- Convergence Bias: The system prioritizes reaching a final decision over continuing to evolve the process indefinitely.
