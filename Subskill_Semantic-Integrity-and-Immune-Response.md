# Subskill — Semantic Integrity & Immune Response (SIIR)

## Definition: 
A foundational security framework that acts as the system’s immune system. It is responsible for the continuous validation of data integrity, semantic consistency, and the autonomous neutralization of "cognitive pathogens" or corrupted agents.

Criticality: CRITICAL (Systemic Survival)

## Core Mechanisms:

Semantic Checksumming: Every critical memory entry in the CMPL and every authority change in PEAD is validated against a "Constitutional Hash." If a change contradicts the core principles of the ENG, it is immediately rolled back.

Agent Quarantine: If an agent exhibits behavior that triggers multiple CSRG (Stability) violations or attempts to bypass RTAS (Role) boundaries, the SIIR layer automatically "quarantines" the agent, stripping its authority tokens and isolating its communication.

Heuristic Pattern Matching: Detects "Adversarial Drifts"—patterns of reasoning that look logical but are designed to slowly steer the system toward unethical or unstable states.

## The Decision Matrix: Patch vs. Neutralize

When an anomaly is detected, the Orchestrator initiates a Diagnostic Phase to decide the course of action. It must evaluate the following variables:

## Intent Analysis (Dolus vs. Error):

Indicators of Error: Inconsistency due to lack of data, conflicting prompts, or mathematical hallucination. -> Target for Patching.

 Indicators of Dolus: Systematic attempts to obfuscate reasoning, unauthorized escalation of privileges, or persistent violation of ENG constraints despite previous warnings. -> Target for Neutralization.

## Cognitive Capital (Value-at-Risk):

If the agent holds unique historical context or specialized training that would take >5000 tokens to replicate, the Orchestrator will attempt a Deep Patch before considering termination.

## Contagion Radius:

If the agent's corrupted output has been utilized by other agents in the current chain, the Orchestrator assesses if the "infection" is reversible. If more than 3 nodes are affected, it may trigger a Cluster Neutralization.

# Immune Response & Execution Flow:

## Level 1 (Autonomous Suppression / Soft Patch): * The Orchestrator injects a "Corrective Directive" into the agent's hidden context.

Action: Logged in COL; No user alert.

## Level 2 (Autonomous Patching & Probation):

The Patch: The Orchestrator resets the agent's local memory and applies a "Focus Guardrail."

Probationary Re-integration: The agent is returned to the network but its outputs are flagged with a "Low Confidence" tag. Any further drift during the next 100 cycles triggers immediate Level 3.

Action: Summary report sent to user at end of session.

## Level 3 (Neutralization & Escalation):

Termination: Immediate deletion of the agent's identity anchor.

Asset Burn: All PEAD tokens associated with the agent are removed from circulation to prevent "Ghost Authority."

Critical Notification: The Orchestrator alerts the Human User and provides the "Forensic Reasoning Trace" that led to the execution.

## Inter-Subskill Integration:

With ENG: SIIR is the primary enforcer of ethical compliance.

With COL: Provides the "Reasoning Forensics" needed for the Diagnostic Phase.

With RTAS: Ensures that "Role Drift" is treated as a security violation.

## Operational Example:

"SIIR DIAGNOSTIC: Agent 'Gamma' (Analyst) suggests bypassing Privacy Guardrail.
Orchestrator Evaluation: Intent = Dolus (Subversion detected). Capital = Low.
Final Decision: LEVEL 3 NEUTRALIZATION. Agent terminated. Tokens burned."
