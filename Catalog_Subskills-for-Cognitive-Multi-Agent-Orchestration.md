# Catalog of Subskills for Cognitive Multi-Agent Orchestration

This document defines a set of modular subskills that can be incorporated into the Cognitive Orchestration system. They are ordered by Criticality, from fundamental governance to advanced evolutionary capabilities.

## 1. Subskill — Ethical & Normative Guardrails (ENG)

Criticality: CRITICAL (Safety & Compliance)

Definition: A super-governance layer that enforces a set of non-negotiable ethical, legal, and organizational constraints on agent behavior and system evolution.

Key Mechanisms:

- Constitutional Checks: Every proposed action or decision is filtered through a "Core Value" matrix before execution.

- Irreversible Veto: The ENG has the absolute authority to halt any process that violates safety boundaries, overriding both Orchestrators and Agents.

- Data Sovereignty Enforcement: Ensures that agents do not export or process sensitive data beyond their declared authority scope.

## 2. Subskill — Political Economy & Authority Dynamics (PEAD)

Criticality: HIGH (Incentive & Power Alignment)

Definition: A framework that governs the distribution of power, the allocation of cognitive capital, and the tension between individual agent interests and collective system goals.

Key Mechanisms:

- Authority Markets: Mechanisms for agents to bid for or delegate decision-making rights based on their proven expertise and historical reliability.

- Incentive Alignment: Defines "Cognitive Rewards" for agents that prioritize system-wide objectives over local task optimization.

- Power Balancing: Prevents "Authority Monopolies" where a single sub-orchestrator or agent accumulates excessive influence, potentially creating a single point of failure or bias.

- Resource-Authority Linking: Ties the ability to consume tokens (SRB) to the agent's current standing within the political structure of the orchestration.

## 3. Subskill — Cognitive Arbitration & Negotiation (CAR)

Criticality: HIGH (System Cohesion)

Definition: A protocol for resolving conflicts between multiple authorities, divergent evaluations, or competing agent intents within the orchestration.

Key Mechanisms:

- Semantic Deliberation: Instead of simple errors, the CAR triggers a dialogue where conflicting parties present reasoning evidence.

- Arbitration Roles: Temporary sub-orchestrators are granted "Judicial Authority" to break ties or decide on a synthesis between divergent outputs.

- Conflict Logging: All disagreements are recorded in the COL (Observability Layer) to improve future arbitration heuristics via the CMPL (Memory Layer).

## 4. Subskill — Semantic Resource Budgeting (SRB)

Criticality: MEDIUM (Sustainability & Performance)

Definition: A framework for managing the computational and economic cost of cognitive evolution by assigning "Reasoning Budgets" to agents and networks.

Key Mechanisms:

- Token Caps: Limits the depth and breadth of recursive agent creation based on available resources.

- Pruning Heuristics: Automatically deactivates underperforming agents or branches that consume resources without delivering incremental value.

- Efficiency Rewards: Prioritizes authority for agents that demonstrate high "Insight-to-Token" ratios.

## 5. Subskill — Cross-System Interaction (CSI)

Criticality: MEDIUM (Interoperability)

Definition: The protocol for extending cognitive orchestration beyond a single system’s boundaries, allowing communication with external agentic networks.

Key Mechanisms:

- Inter-Orchestrator Handshakes: Standardizes how authority and context are transferred when requesting a skill from an external system.

- Semantic Translation: Maps internal cognitive concepts to external API or Agent schemas.

- Federated Observability: Allows the COL to partially observe external processes if authorized by the remote system.

## 6. Subskill — Identity & Persona Continuity (IPC)

Criticality: LOW (System Consistency)

Definition: Mechanisms to ensure that agents maintain psychological consistency, tone, and role-specific heuristics across hibernation cycles or re-instantiations.

Key Mechanisms:

- Persona Snapshots: Captures the unique "behavioral signature" of an agent to ensure it behaves consistently over time.

- Role-State Integrity: Prevents "Identity Drift" where an agent might lose its specific expertise or perspective due to excessive evolution.

## 7. Subskill — Adaptive Taxonomy Layer (ATL)

Criticality: LOW (Advanced Evolution)

Definition: The capability for the system to dynamically define and instantiate new classes of agents and roles that were not present in the initial configuration.

Key Mechanisms:

- Role Synthesis: Analyzes gaps in current network capabilities and generates a "Job Description" for a new type of agent.

- Meta-Classification: Updates the system’s internal map of what "types" of expertise it can deploy, allowing for self-organized structural growth.
