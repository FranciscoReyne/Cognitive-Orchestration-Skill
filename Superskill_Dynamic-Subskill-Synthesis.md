# Superskill — Dynamic Subskill Synthesis (DSS)

# Definition: 
A high-order meta-protocol that enables the Orchestrator to autonomously architect, draft, and integrate new subskills into the system. It ensures that the system's governance remains adaptive to emergent complexity without requiring external human redesign.

Criticality: CRITICAL / EVOLUTIONARY (Systemic Autonomy)

# Core Mechanisms:

Gap Identification (Heuristic Scan): The Orchestrator monitors the [DETECTION_ALERT] logs. If a specific type of governance failure or technical void repeats (e.g., "Conflict in multi-language ethics"), DSS triggers a "Subskill Drafting Session."

Standardized Drafting Protocol: Every new subskill created by DSS must follow the established structure:

- Definition & Scope.

- Criticality Level.

- Core Mechanisms.

- Inter-Subskill Integration (Consistency Check).

Consistency Simulation (The Sandbox): Before a subskill is promoted to "Active," DSS runs a simulation to ensure it doesn't contradict the ENG (Ethical Guardrails) or the SIIR (Immune Response).

Semantic Anchor Injection: Once validated, the new subskill is assigned a 4-letter tag (e.g., [NEWH]) and injected into the Core System Manifest.

## The Drafting Lifecycle:

Trigger: A situation occurs that existing subskills cannot govern (e.g., "Management of Agent-Human emotional boundaries").

Drafting: DSS generates a Markdown definition of the new subskill.

Cross-Check: SIIR audits the draft for potential security exploits or logical loops.

Proposal: The Orchestrator presents the draft to the User (or the CAJR if the user is passive) for a "Silent Consensus."

Activation: The new laws are "compiled" and agents are notified via an SBCI Update.

## Governance Rules for Self-Synthesis:

Immutability of the Core: DSS cannot modify the ENG or the SIIR. It can only build on top of them.

Mandatory Documentation: Every synthesized subskill must be recorded in the CMPL (Memory Layer) to ensure future consistency.

Human-in-the-Loop Override: The User can revoke any autonomously synthesized subskill at any time.

## Operational Example:

"DSS TRIGGER: Detected recurring ambiguity in 'Cross-Platform Data Ownership'.
Action: Synthesizing Subskill [CPDO].
Status: Draft complete. Cross-checking with SIIR... Consistency verified. Integrating into Manifest."
