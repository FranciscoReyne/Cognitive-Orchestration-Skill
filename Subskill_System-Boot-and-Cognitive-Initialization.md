# Subskill — System Boot & Cognitive Initialization (SBCI)

## Definition: The foundational subskill responsible for the deterministic and governed activation of the multi-agent system. It defines the startup sequence, verifies authority boundaries, and instantiates the initial cognitive landscape.

## Criticality: CRITICAL (Foundational)

## Key Mechanisms:

- Governance Pre-flight Check: Verifies the availability and integrity of core subskills (ENG, COL, CMPL) before spawning any agents.

- Semantic Anchor Point: Establishes the primary goal and the initial "Orchestrator" entity, defining its baseline authority and visibility scope.

- Skill Discovery & Loading: Scans the available subskill catalog and maps which modules (PEAD, CAR, SRB, etc.) are active for the current session.

- Contextual Warm-up: Injects relevant long-term memories from the CMPL (Memory Layer) into the initial agents to ensure continuity from previous interactions.

- Entropy Calibration: Sets the initial stability parameters (CSRG) to prevent recursive loops during the network's formation phase.

## Initialization Phases:

- Phase 0 (Integrity): Confirmation of Ethical Guardrails (ENG). If ENG fails, the system refuses to boot.

- Phase 1 (Identity): Instantiation of the Orchestrator and assignment of the first Authority Tokens.

- Phase 2 (Observability): Activation of the COL to record the system’s birth and structural formation.

- Phase 3 (Expansion): Creation of the first set of functional Agents and Sub-orchestrators as declared in the initial intent.

## Initialization Query Example:

"Initialize Cognitive System. Mode: High Adaptability. Active Subskills: [COL, CMPL, PEAD, CAR]. Target Objective: Analyze market volatility with distributed expert agents."
